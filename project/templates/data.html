            <h3><u>TouchPoint Table</u></h3>
            <div>
                This table decreases priority for friends who have existing common overlaps of interaction with you.
                It is our belief that if you go to the same college as your friend you likely speak to them more often due to social events (housing day, study breaks, etc).
                Therefore, you do not have to find as much time in your schedule to reach out separately.
                Those friends that you share less common overlaps with should come up higher on your TouchPoint list because you likely do not speak to them as regularly in your schedule!
